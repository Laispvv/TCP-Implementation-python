                                     SHREK
                         Once upon a time there was a lovely 
                         princess. But she had an enchantment 
                         upon her of a fearful sort which could 
                         only be broken by love's first kiss. 
                         She was locked away in a castle guarded 
                         by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. 
                         Many brave knights had attempted to 
                         free her from this dreadful prison, 
                         but non prevailed. She waited in the 
                         dragon's keep in the highest room of 
                         the tallest tower for her true love 
                         and true love's first kiss. (laughs) 
                         Like that's ever gonna happen. What 
                         a load of - (toilet flush)
 
               Allstar - by Smashmouth begins to play. Shrek goes about his 
               day. While in a nearby town, the villagers get together to go 
               after the ogre.
 
               NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME

                                     MAN1
                         Think it's in there?

                                     MAN2
                         All right. Let's get it!MAN1
                         Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that 
                         thing can do to you?
 
                                     MAN3
                         Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's 
                         bread.
 
               Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.

                                     SHREK
                         Yes, well, actually, that would be a 
                         giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. 
                         They'll make a suit from your freshly 
                         peeled skin.
 
                                     MEN
                         No!

                                     SHREK
                         They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the 
                         jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's 
                         quite good on toast.
 
                                     MAN1
                         Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! 
                         (waves the torch at Shrek.)
 
               Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The 
               men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long 
               and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the 
               men are in the dark.
 
                                     SHREK
                         This is the part where you run away. 
                         (The men scramble toget away. He laughs.) 
                         And stay out! (looks down and picks 
                         up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. 
                         Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and 
                         throws the paper over his shoulder.)
 
                         
               THE NEXT DAY

               There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard 
               sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures 
               to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line 
               are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto 
               who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three 
               little pigs.
 
                                     GUARD
                         All right. This one's full. Take it 
                         away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!
 
                         
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next!

                                     GUARD
                         (taking the witch's broom) Give me that! 
                         Your flying days are over. (breaks the 
                         broom in half)
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. 
                         Next!
 
                                     GUARD
                         Get up! Come on!HEAD GUARD
                         Twenty pieces.

                                     LITTLE BEAR
                         (crying) This cage is too small.

                                     DONKEY
                         Please, don't turn me in. I'll never 
                         be stubborn again. I can change. Please! 
                         Give me another chance!
 
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)

                                     DONKEY
                         Oh!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     GIPETTO
                         This little wooden puppet.

                                     PINOCCHIO
                         I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his 
                         nose grows)
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Five shillings for the possessed toy. 
                         Take it away.
 
                                     PINOCCHIO
                         Father, please! Don't let them do this! 
                         Help me!
 
               Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up 
               to the table.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Next! What have you got?

                                     OLD WOMANWell, I've got a talking donkey.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, 
                         if you can prove it.
 
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, go ahead, little fella.

               Donkey just looks up at her.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Well?

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little 
                         nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. 
                         Talk, you boneheaded dolt...
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
 
                         
                                     OLD WOMAN
                         No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends 
                         to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to 
                         talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing 
                         you ever saw.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Get her out of my sight.

                                     OLD WOMAN
                         No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!

               The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One 
               of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's 
               hands, and her cage drops onDonkey's head. He gets sprinkled 
               with fairy dust and he's able to fly.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Hey! I can fly!

                                     PETER PAN
                         He can fly!

                                     3 LITTLE PIGS
                         He can fly!

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         He can talk!

                                     DONKEY
                         Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm 
                         a flying, talking donkey. You might 
                         have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly 
                         but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey 
                         fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins 
                         to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink 
                         to the ground.)
 
               He hits the ground with a thud.

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         Seize him! (Donkey takes of running.) 
                         After him!
 
                                     GUARDS
                         He's getting away! Get him! This way! 
                         Turn!
 
               Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally. 
               Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared 
               for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. Hequickly hides behind Shrek.
 
                                     HEAD GUARD
                         You there. Ogre!

                                     SHREK
                         Aye?

                                     HEAD GUARD
                         By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized 
                         to place you both under arrest and transport 
                         you to a designated resettlement facility.
 
                         
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, really? You and what army?

               He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well 
               and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail 
               and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and 
               begins walking back to his cottage.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Can I say something to you? Listen, 
                         you was really, really, really somethin' 
                         back here. Incredible!
 
                                     SHREK
                         Are you talkin' to...(he turns around 
                         and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back 
                         around and Donkey is right in front 
                         of him.) Whoa!
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tellyou that you that you was great back 
                         here? Those guards! They thought they 
                         was all of that. Then you showed up, 
                         and bam! They was trippin' over themselves 
                         like babes in the woods. That really 
                         made me feel good to see that.
 
                                     SHREK
                         Oh, that's great. Really.

                                     DONKEY
                         Man, it's good to be free.

                                     SHREK
                         Now, why don't you go celebrate your 
                         freedom with your own friends? Hmm?
 
                         
                                     DONKEY
                         But, uh, I don't have any friends. And 
                         I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, 
                         wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll 
                         stick with you. You're mean, green, 
                         fightin' machine. Together we'll scare 
                         the spit out of anybody that crosses 
                         us.
 
               Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very 
               loudly.
 
                                     DONKEY
                         Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you 
                         don't mind me sayin', if that don't
